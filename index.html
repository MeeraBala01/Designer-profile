              I had grown a little bit disappointed when I realized that my work
              would not be taking me in any new, creative design directions.
              Thankfully, I found Shambhavi Mishra and his creativity that goes
              above and beyond, proving to be exactly what I needed to take.

              Shambhavi Mishra is the best designer that I have ever worked
              with. He is seriously what you would call 'creative': he
              innovatively solves all sorts of problems and always delivers both
              prompt and high quality work. I can't recommend him enough!

            <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am Shambhavi Mishra from Lucknow, India. I am working in an
              Indian Startup as a Product Designer for the past one year. <br />
              I got featured various times on many big and small marketplaces,
              portfolio websites and blogs. I also received some awards and
              recognitions from some of the big and small award companies.
              Besides designing, I like to write poems, stories and sing songs.
